# Claim MIR Reward

MIR reward is generated in three different ways on Mirror Protocol:

1. Long Farm (Stake LP Tokens)
2. Short Farm (Create Short position)
3. Voting Reward (From voting on governance polls that are in progress)

Although reward is distributed in three different channels, they are all claimable by executing one transaction from **My Page.**&#x20;

1 . Navigate to **My Page** and click `Claim All Rewards`
