# Stake

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers staking LP tokens on [mETH](https://eth.mirror.finance). \
Staking guide for Mirror Web App is available [here](broken-reference).
{% endhint %}

Users can stake mAsset-UST LP or MIR-UST LP tokens to earn MIR reward.&#x20;

Each staking position is unique to each type of LP tokens specified by the mAsset-UST pair. Also, due to different `weight` and pool price of each mAsset, each farming position has a different Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which represents the yearly MIR reward from staking LP tokens.

## Stake / Unstake LP Tokens

1\. From the [Stake (Main)](https://eth.mirror.finance) page, select `Stake LP` from the pool which you hold LP for.&#x20;

* A staking pool where the user has LP tokens already staked will show a `Staked` label on top of the box.
* A staking pool where the user has LP to stake will show a `Stakable` label on top of the box.
