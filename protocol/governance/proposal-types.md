# Proposal Types

Governance proposals on the Mirror Protocol can come in a variety of formats. There are four main categories of governance proposals: **Asset Listing, Reward Distribution, Parameter Modification, and Suggestion / Others.**

### Asset Listing

#### 1. Suggest Asset Whitelisting

{% hint style="info" %}
The full process of getting a new asset to be fully operational on the Mirror Protocol is described [here](whitelist-procedure.md).
{% endhint %}

The function of this proposal is to start a poll to whitelist a new asset. Given that this is a simple text proposal, there are a few fields that need to be filled. The `Asset Name`, `Ticker`, `Listed Exchange`, and `Reason for listing` are required. The length of the description field is limited to 1024 bytes. It is suggested that additional information be added on a separate web page and linked to using the `Information Link` field.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28138%29.png)

Information that would be necessary for a voter to make informed decisions should be clearly stated in addition to reasons for listing this asset and the asset name and ticker. For example, simply stating:

`Google should be listed because it is a popular stock`

has numerous problems. First, the specific exchange that the price feed should be taken from is not clearly stated \(many companies are dual-listed\). Second, Google actually has two stocks that are publicly traded: `GOOGL` and `GOOG` \(the former has voting rights whereas the latter does not\). In addition, the official name registered with NASDAQ is not `Google` but rather `Alphabet Inc.` Thus it is extremely important to make it as clear as possible to others about the asset that you intend to whitelist.

| Field | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Asset Name | Name of the asset to be whitelisted | Required |
| Ticker | Ticker of asset to be whitelisted | Required |
| Listed Exchange | Exchange that the underlying asset trades on | Required |
| Reason for listing | Short description of whitelist reason | Required |
| Information Link | External URL for further information | Optional |
| Suggested Oracle | Oracle provider or address | Optional |

#### 2. Register Whitelist Parameters

If a proposal to whitelist is approved, another poll must be passed to set the parameters of the newly listed asset. The required fields include `Title`, `Description`, `Asset Name`, `Symbol`, `Oracle Feeder` \(address\), `Auction Discount`, and the `Minimum Collateral Ratio`. Again, it is advised to include reference to the passed whitelist poll as well as reasoning for choosing the given oracle address. Given that the Mirror Protocol is in its early stages, it is advisable to keep the parameters equal to existing parameters for already listed assets \(Auction Discount at 20%, and Minimum Collateral Ratio at 150%\).  
  
The original 13 mAssets utilize Band Protocolâ€™s feeders, so a rough guideline to communicate with Band Protocol to receive the oracle address is provided below. If another oracle address would like to be suggested, please input the address in the Oracle Feeder field.

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure proper functioning of the price feed, newly whitelisted asset on Mirror Protocol also undergo a 1 week testing period where the prices are still fed by the oracle but no buy/sell, mint, or staking actions can be performed.

The function of this proposal is to start a poll to whitelist an asset which is scheduled to go through an initial public offering \(or IPO\), but is not publicly listed yet. Similar to the "Suggest asset whitelisting" proposal, this is also a text proposal. Fields that need to be filled are `Asset Name`, `Ticker`, `Listed Exchange`, and `Reason for listing`. It is suggested that additional information on the IPO or supporting information to be added using the `Information Link` field.
