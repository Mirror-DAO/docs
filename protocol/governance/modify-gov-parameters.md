# Modify Gov Parameters

Currently on Mirror Protocol, the`Effective Delay`and `Voter Weight`have been set as follows:

| Effective Delay | 86400 seconds (1 day) |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Voter Weight    | 50%                   |

For more specific information about each parameter, please refer to [**Modify Gov Parameters**](proposal-types.md#5-modify-governance-parameters).

When submitting a poll to change a governance parameter, at least one field must be entered. Note that only one optional parameter may be requested to be changed per poll.
