# Delist Procedure

As whitelisting of a new mAsset is fully governed in a decentralized way by MIR stakers, they can also choose to [**delist**](../mirrored-assets-massets.md#delisting-and-migration) a specific mAsset that is already registered on Mirror Protocol by submitting a new poll which should define which mAsset should be delisted. 

When the submitted poll is approved by governance, the corresponding mAsset will be labeled as delisted and users will be able to unstake LP & sLP, withdraw collateral, close CDP and burn their delisted asset holdings against any CDP to claim the respective value of the collateral from any position.
